 I. Introduction

The Wen Quan Yi bitmap font includes complete CJK Unified 
Ideograph (U4E00 - U9FA5) glyphs at four different sizes 
(9pt-12X12 pixel, 10pt-13X13 pixel, 11pt-15X15 pixel, 
12pt-16x16 pixel) and two weights (medium and bold). 
Use of this bitmap font for on-screen display of Chinese 
(traditional and simplified) in web pages and elsewhere 
eliminates the annoying "blurring" problems caused by 
the high stroke density of many Chinese characters and 
insufficient "hinting" of anti-aliased Chinese fonts. 
This font also provides bitmap glyphs for Japanese 
Hiragana (U3040 - U309F), Katakana (U30A0 - U30FF) 
and for Korean Hangul (UAC00 - UD7A3).

This font builds upon the previous works by firefly
(firefly[at]firefly(dot)idv(dot)tw)[2] and The Institute 
of Software, Academia Sinica[3].

We release this font to the public as an open-source software 
in terms of GPL. You are free to copy, distribute, and/or 
modify this font as long as you pass the freedom to the users
of the derived work.

We hope you find this font useful. Please send your feedback,

 III. About The WenQuanYi Project

The WenQuanYi Project was created by Qianqian Fang[8] in 
Oct 2004. The goal of this project is to enrich open-source 
Chinese software/resources and construct an open language
platform for Eastern Asia (Chinese, Japanese and Korean etc) 
open source communities. A mile-stone of the framework is 
to create high quality bitmap character glyphs and outline 
fonts for all 70,000+ CJK characters currently encoded 
by the Unicode Consortium. 

The WenQuanYi Project use Wiki[1] as the primary 
development tool for glyph creation, documentation
and organization. The project is greatly benefited from the
large-scale/distributed/parallel cooperative  
mechanism provided by Wiki engine. About half of the 
font editing (more than 16,000) works were completed with
the JavaScript tools in Wiki page.

There project consists of a "Steering Committee" by the
core members, and a "Team B" for bitmap Chinese font 
development, a "Team V" for outline font development.
Need to mention, a large number of anonymous contributors 
also participate our development through our Wiki site
and their contributions are non-negligible.
